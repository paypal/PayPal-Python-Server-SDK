     Defines a contract for providing HTTP client configuration.

     Classes implementing this interface are expected to supply a configured
     HTTP session and timeout value that will be used by the SDK's internal
     HTTP layer when making network requests.

     This allows developers to inject their own custom HTTP clients while
     maintaining compatibility with the SDK's request/response handling.
