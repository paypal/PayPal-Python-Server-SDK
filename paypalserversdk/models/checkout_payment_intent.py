class CheckoutPaymentIntent(object):

    """Implementation of the 'Checkout Payment Intent' enum.

    The intent to either capture payment immediately or authorize a payment
    for an order after order creation.

    Attributes:
        CAPTURE: The merchant intends to capture payment immediately after the
            customer makes a payment.
        AUTHORIZE: The merchant intends to authorize a payment and place funds
            on hold after the customer makes a payment. Authorized payments
            are best captured within three days of authorization but are
            available to capture for up to 29 days. After the three-day honor
            period, the original authorized payment expires and you must
            re-authorize the payment. You must make a separate request to
            capture payments on demand. This intent is not supported when you
            have more than one `purchase_unit` within your order.
