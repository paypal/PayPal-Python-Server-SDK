class FulfillmentType(object):

    """Implementation of the 'Fulfillment Type' enum.

    A classification for the method of purchase fulfillment (e.g shipping,
    in-store pickup, etc). Either `type` or `options` may be present, but not
    both.

    Attributes:
        SHIPPING: The payer intends to receive the items at a specified
            address.
        PICKUP_IN_PERSON: DEPRECATED. Please use "PICKUP_FROM_PERSON" instead.
        PICKUP_IN_STORE: The payer intends to pick up the item(s) from the
            payee's physical store. Also termed as BOPIS, "Buy Online, Pick-up
            in Store". Seller protection is provided with this option.
        PICKUP_FROM_PERSON: The payer intends to pick up the item(s) from the
            payee in person. Also termed as BOPIP, "Buy Online, Pick-up in
            Person". Seller protection is not available, since the payer is
            receiving the item from the payee in person, and can validate the
            item prior to payment.
