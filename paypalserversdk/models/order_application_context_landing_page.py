class OrderApplicationContextLandingPage(object):

    """Implementation of the 'Order Application Context Landing Page' enum.

    DEPRECATED. DEPRECATED. The type of landing page to show on the PayPal
    site for customer checkout.  The fields in `application_context` are now
    available in the `experience_context` object under the `payment_source`
    which supports them (eg.
    `payment_source.paypal.experience_context.landing_page`). Please specify
    this field in the `experience_context` object instead of the
    `application_context` object.

    Attributes:
        LOGIN: When the customer clicks PayPal Checkout, the customer is
            redirected to a page to log in to PayPal and approve the payment.
        BILLING: When the customer clicks PayPal Checkout, the customer is
            redirected to a page to enter credit or debit card and other
            relevant billing information required to complete the purchase.
        NO_PREFERENCE: When the customer clicks PayPal Checkout, the customer
            is redirected to either a page to log in to PayPal and approve the
            payment or to a page to enter credit or debit card and other
            relevant billing information required to complete the purchase,
            depending on their previous interaction with PayPal.
