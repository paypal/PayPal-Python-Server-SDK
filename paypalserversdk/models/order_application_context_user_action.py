class OrderApplicationContextUserAction(object):

    """Implementation of the 'Order Application Context User Action' enum.

    DEPRECATED. Configures a Continue or Pay Now checkout flow.  The fields in
    `application_context` are now available in the `experience_context` object
    under the `payment_source` which supports them (eg.
    `payment_source.paypal.experience_context.user_action`). Please specify
    this field in the `experience_context` object instead of the
    `application_context` object.

    Attributes:
        CONTINUE: After you redirect the customer to the PayPal payment page,
            a Continue button appears. Use this option when the final amount
            is not known when the checkout flow is initiated and you want to
            redirect the customer to the merchant page without processing the
            payment.
        PAY_NOW: After you redirect the customer to the PayPal payment page, a
            Pay Now button appears. Use this option when the final amount is
            known when the checkout is initiated and you want to process the
            payment immediately when the customer clicks Pay Now.
