class OrderStatus(object):

    """Implementation of the 'Order Status' enum.

    The order status.

    Attributes:
        CREATED: The order was created with the specified context.
        SAVED: The order was saved and persisted. The order status continues
            to be in progress until a capture is made with final_capture =
            true for all purchase units within the order.
        APPROVED: The customer approved the payment through the PayPal wallet
            or another form of guest or unbranded payment. For example, a
            card, bank account, or so on.
        VOIDED: All purchase units in the order are voided.
        COMPLETED: The intent of the order was completed and a `payments`
            resource was created. Important: Check the payment status in
            `purchase_units[].payments.captures[].status` before fulfilling
            the order. A completed order can indicate a payment was
            authorized, an authorized payment was captured, or a payment was
            declined.
        PAYER_ACTION_REQUIRED: The order requires an action from the payer
            (e.g. 3DS authentication). Redirect the payer to the
            "rel":"payer-action" HATEOAS link returned as part of the response
            prior to authorizing or capturing the order. Some payment sources
            may not return a payer-action HATEOAS link (eg. MB WAY). For these
            payment sources the payer-action is managed by the scheme itself
            (eg. through SMS, email, in-app notification, etc).
