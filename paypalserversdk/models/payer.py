    """Implementation of the 'Payer' model.

    The customer who approves and pays for the order. The customer is also known as
    the payer.

    Attributes:
        email_address (str): The internationalized email address. Note: Up to 64
            characters are allowed before and 255 characters are allowed after the @
            sign. However, the generally accepted maximum length for an email address
            is 254 characters. The pattern verifies that an unquoted @ sign exists.
        payer_id (str): The account identifier for a PayPal account.
        name (Name): The name of the party.
        phone (PhoneWithType): The phone information.
        birth_date (str): The stand-alone date, in [Internet date and time
            format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6). To represent
            special legal values, such as a date of birth, you should use dates with
            no associated time or time-zone data. Whenever possible, use the standard
            `date_time` type. This regular expression does not validate all dates.
            For example, February 31 is valid and nothing is known about leap years.
        tax_info (TaxInfo): The tax ID of the customer. The customer is also known as
            the payer. Both `tax_id` and `tax_id_type` are required.
        address (Address): The portable international postal address. Maps to
            [AddressValidationMetadata](https://github.com/googlei18n/libaddressinput/
            wiki/AddressValidationMetadata) and HTML 5.1 [Autofilling form controls:
