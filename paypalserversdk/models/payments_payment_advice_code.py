class PaymentsPaymentAdviceCode(object):

    """Implementation of the 'Payments Payment Advice Code' enum.

    The declined payment transactions might have payment advice codes. The
    card networks, like Visa and Mastercard, return payment advice codes.

    Attributes:
        PAYMENTADVICE_01: For Mastercard, expired card account upgrade or
            portfolio sale conversion. Obtain new account information before
            next billing cycle.
        PAYMENTADVICE_02: For Mastercard, over credit limit or insufficient
            funds. Retry the transaction 72 hours later. For Visa, the card
            holder wants to stop only one specific payment in the recurring
            payment relationship. The merchant must NOT resubmit the same
            transaction. The merchant can continue the billing process in the
            subsequent billing period.
        PAYMENTADVICE_03: For Mastercard, account closed as fraudulent. Obtain
            another type of payment from customer due to account being closed
            or fraud. Possible reason: Account closed as fraudulent. For Visa,
            the card holder wants to stop all recurring payment transactions
            for a specific merchant. Stop recurring payment requests.
        PAYMENTADVICE_21: For Mastercard, the card holder has been
            unsuccessful at canceling recurring payment through merchant. Stop
            recurring payment requests. For Visa, all recurring payments were
            canceled for the card number requested. Stop recurring payment
            requests.
