class PaypalExperienceLandingPage(object):

    """Implementation of the 'PayPal Experience Landing Page' enum.

    The type of landing page to show on the PayPal site for customer checkout.

    Attributes:
        LOGIN: When the customer clicks PayPal Checkout, the customer is
            redirected to a page to log in to PayPal and approve the payment.
        GUEST_CHECKOUT: When the customer clicks PayPal Checkout, the customer
            is redirected to a page to enter credit or debit card and other
            relevant billing information required to complete the purchase.
            This option has previously been also called as 'BILLING'
        NO_PREFERENCE: When the customer clicks PayPal Checkout, the customer
            is redirected to either a page to log in to PayPal and approve the
            payment or to a page to enter credit or debit card and other
            relevant billing information required to complete the purchase,
            depending on their previous interaction with PayPal.
        BILLING: DEPRECATED - please use GUEST_CHECKOUT. All implementations
            of 'BILLING' will be routed to 'GUEST_CHECKOUT'. When the customer
            clicks PayPal Checkout, the customer is redirected to a page to
            enter credit or debit card and other relevant billing information
            required to complete the purchase.
