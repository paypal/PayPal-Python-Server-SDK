class PaypalWalletContextShippingPreference(object):

    """Implementation of the 'PayPal Wallet Context Shipping Preference' enum.

    The location from which the shipping address is derived.

    Attributes:
        GET_FROM_FILE: Get the customer-provided shipping address on the
            PayPal site.
        NO_SHIPPING: Removes the shipping address information from the API
            response and the Paypal site. However, the shipping.phone_number
            and shipping.email_address fields will still be returned to allow
            for digital goods delivery.
        SET_PROVIDED_ADDRESS: Get the merchant-provided address. The customer
            cannot change this address on the PayPal site. If merchant does
            not pass an address, customer can choose the address on PayPal
            pages.
