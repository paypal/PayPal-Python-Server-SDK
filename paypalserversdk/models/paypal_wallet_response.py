    """Implementation of the 'PayPal Wallet Response' model.

    The PayPal Wallet response.

    Attributes:
        email_address (str): The internationalized email
            address.<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Up to 64 characters are
            allowed before and 255 characters are allowed after the
            <code>@</code> sign. However, the generally accepted maximum
            length for an email address is 254 characters. The pattern
            verifies that an unquoted <code>@</code> sign exists.</blockquote>
        account_id (str): The PayPal payer ID, which is a masked version of
            the PayPal account number intended for use with third parties. The
            account number is reversibly encrypted and a proprietary variant
            of Base32 is used to encode the result.
        account_status (PaypalWalletAccountVerificationStatus): The account
            status indicates whether the buyer has verified the financial
            details associated with their PayPal account.
        name (Name): The name of the party.
        phone_type (PhoneType): The phone type.
        phone_number (PhoneNumber): The phone number in its canonical
            international [E.164 numbering plan
            format](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en).
        birth_date (str): The stand-alone date, in [Internet date and time
            format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6). To
            represent special legal values, such as a date of birth, you
            should use dates with no associated time or time-zone data.
            Whenever possible, use the standard `date_time` type. This regular
            expression does not validate all dates. For example, February 31
            is valid and nothing is known about leap years.
        business_name (str): The business name of the PayPal account holder
            (populated for business accounts only)
        tax_info (TaxInfo): The tax ID of the customer. The customer is also
            known as the payer. Both `tax_id` and `tax_id_type` are required.
        address (Address): The portable international postal address. Maps to
            [AddressValidationMetadata](https://github.com/googlei18n/libaddres
            sinput/wiki/AddressValidationMetadata) and HTML 5.1 [Autofilling
            form controls: the autocomplete
            attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/sec-forms.html#autofilling-
            form-controls-the-autocomplete-attribute).
        attributes (PaypalWalletAttributesResponse): Additional attributes
            associated with the use of a PayPal Wallet.
