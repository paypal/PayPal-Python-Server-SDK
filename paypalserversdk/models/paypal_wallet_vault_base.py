    """Implementation of the 'PayPal Wallet Vault Base' model.

    Resource consolidating common request and response attributes for vaulting PayPal
    Wallet.

    Attributes:
        store_in_vault (StoreInVaultInstruction): Defines how and when the payment
            source gets vaulted.
        description (str): The description displayed to PayPal consumer on the
            approval flow for PayPal, as well as on the PayPal payment token
            management experience on PayPal.com.
        usage_pattern (UsagePattern): Expected business/pricing model for the billing
            agreement.
        usage_type (UsageType): The usage type associated with the PayPal payment
            token.
        customer_type (PaypalPaymentTokenCustomerType): The customer type associated
            with the PayPal payment token. This is to indicate whether the customer
            acting on the merchant / platform is either a business or a consumer.
        permit_multiple_payment_tokens (bool): Create multiple payment tokens for the
            same payer, merchant/platform combination. Use this when the customer has
            not logged in at merchant/platform. The payment token thus generated, can
            then also be used to create the customer account at merchant/platform.
            Use this also when multiple payment tokens are required for the same
            payer, different customer at merchant/platform. This helps to identify
            customers distinctly even though they may share the same PayPal account.
            This only applies to PayPal payment source.
