    """Implementation of the 'Standard Entry Class Code' enum.

    NACHA (the regulatory body governing the ACH network) requires that API
    callers (merchants, partners) obtain the consumer’s explicit authorization
    before initiating a transaction. To stay compliant, you’ll need to make
    sure that you retain a compliant authorization for each transaction that
    you originate to the ACH Network using this API. ACH transactions are
    categorized (using SEC codes) by how you capture authorization from the
    Receiver (the person whose bank account is being debited or credited).
    PayPal supports the following SEC codes.

    Attributes:
        TEL: The API caller (merchant/partner) accepts authorization and
            payment information from a consumer over the telephone.
        WEB: The API caller (merchant/partner) accepts Debit transactions from
            a consumer on their website.
        CCD: Cash concentration and disbursement for corporate debit
            transaction. Used to disburse or consolidate funds. Entries are
            usually Optional high-dollar, low-volume, and time-critical. (e.g.
            intra-company transfers or invoice payments to suppliers).
        PPD: Prearranged payment and deposit entries. Used for debit payments
            authorized by a consumer account holder, and usually initiated by
            a company. These are usually recurring debits (such as insurance
            premiums).
