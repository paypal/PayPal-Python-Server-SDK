class VaultCardVerificationMethod(object):

    """Implementation of the 'Vault Card Verification Method' enum.

    The verification method of the card.

    Attributes:
        SCA_WHEN_REQUIRED: When an authorization or transaction is attempted
            this option will return a contingency and HATEOAS link only when
            local regulations require strong customer authentication, (e.g.
            3DS in countries and use cases where it is mandated). The API
            caller should redirect the payer to the link so that they can
            authenticate themselves. In all cases, when an authorization is
            requested the AVS/CVV results will be returned in the response.
        SCA_ALWAYS: Selecting this option will attempt to force a strong
            customer authentication for the authorization/transaction. In
            countries where SCA has been defined and implemented it will
            result in a contingency and HATEOAS link being returned.  The API
            caller should redirect the payer to that link so that they can
            authenticate themselves against their issuing bank or other
            entity. As noted, the HATEOAS link is only available in all
            regions where strong authentication is supported, (e.g. in
            European countries where 3DS is live). Merchants can use this
            setting as an additional layer of security if they choose to. In
            all cases, when an authorization is requested the AVS/CVV results
            will be returned in the response.
