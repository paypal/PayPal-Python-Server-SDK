    """Implementation of the 'Vault PayPal Wallet Request' model.

    A resource representing a request to vault PayPal Wallet.

    Attributes:
        description (str): The description displayed to the consumer on the
            approval flow for a digital wallet, as well as on the merchant
            view of the payment token management experience. exp: PayPal.com.
        shipping (VaultedDigitalWalletShippingDetails): The shipping details.
        permit_multiple_payment_tokens (bool): Create multiple payment tokens
            for the same payer, merchant/platform combination. Use this when
            the customer has not logged in at merchant/platform. The payment
            token thus generated, can then also be used to create the customer
            account at merchant/platform. Use this also when multiple payment
            tokens are required for the same payer, different customer at
            merchant/platform. This helps to identify customers distinctly
            even though they may share the same PayPal account. This only
            applies to PayPal payment source.
        usage_type (str): The usage type associated with a digital wallet
            payment token.
        customer_type (str): The customer type associated with a digital
            wallet payment token. This is to indicate whether the customer
            acting on the merchant / platform is either a business or a
            consumer.
        experience_context (VaultExperienceContext): Customizes the Vault
            creation flow experience for your customers.
