    """Implementation of the 'Venmo Wallet Vault Attributes' model.

    Resource consolidating common request and response attirbutes for vaulting
    Venmo Wallet.

    Attributes:
        store_in_vault (StoreInVaultInstruction): Defines how and when the
            payment source gets vaulted.
        description (str): The description displayed to Venmo consumer on the
            approval flow for Venmo, as well as on the Venmo payment token
            management experience on Venmo.com.
        usage_pattern (VenmoPaymentTokenUsagePattern): Expected
            business/pricing model for the billing agreement.
        usage_type (VenmoPaymentTokenUsageType): The usage type associated
            with the Venmo payment token.
        customer_type (VenmoPaymentTokenCustomerType): The customer type
            associated with the Venmo payment token. This is to indicate
            whether the customer acting on the merchant / platform is either a
            business or a consumer.
        permit_multiple_payment_tokens (bool): Create multiple payment tokens
            for the same payer, merchant/platform combination. Use this when
            the customer has not logged in at merchant/platform. The payment
            token thus generated, can then also be used to create the customer
            account at merchant/platform. Use this also when multiple payment
            tokens are required for the same payer, different customer at
            merchant/platform. This helps to identify customers distinctly
            even though they may share the same Venmo account.
